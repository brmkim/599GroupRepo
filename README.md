## Research Topic
### The Trend of U.S. Import from China over the Years
We were curious on the trade trends between China and the US, especially how the US's tariff on Chinese good has impacted the overall import amount in the country. To look at the trend, we collected annual tariff rates, non-household per capita income, and the U.S. population as our explanatory variables and used the overall import from China in US dollar.
