## Research Topic
### The Trend of U.S. Import from China over the Years
We were curious on the trade trends between China and the US, especially how the US's tariff on Chinese good has impacted the overall import amount in the country. To look at the trend, we collected annual tariff rates, non-household per capita income, and the U.S. population as our explanatory variables and used the overall import from China in US dollar. 

Curiosity on trade trends over the course of a number of administrations, just to get an idea of annual imports, annual tariff rates, non-household per capita income, how they are related if they are, and what sort of an impact each variable has on imports - so, for our project, we chose US imports from China
